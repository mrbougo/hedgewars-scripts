=================

Some custom hedgewars scripts I made.

### Better Balanced Random Weapon
An improvement of the default Balanced Random Weapon. This includes the newer weapons (Hammer, Sine Gun, Meat Cleaver, Piano Strike).

### Sandbox
In this mode, you can spawn things using the teleport item. Press up/down while teleport is selected to cycle through the items you can spawn, then press shift (or the key you bound to "Precise") and click to place.

The mine fountain spawns 100 mines. You can only have one mine fountain active at once. If you try to place a second while the first is still going, it will instead stop the first one and not spawn any new one.

### Barrel Mudball
Press shift (or your "Precise" key) while launching a mudball to launch a barrel instead.
