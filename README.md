=================

Some custom hedgewars scripts I made.

### Better Balanced Random Weapon
An improvement of the default Balanced Random Weapon.
This includes the newer weapons (Hammer, Sine Gun, Meat Cleaver, Piano Strike).

### Sandbox
In this mode, you can spawn things using the teleport item.
Press up/down while teleport is selected to open the menu and use the arrow keys to navigate it.
When your selection is made, hold shift (or the key you bound to "Precise") and click to place.

Fountain mode spawns multiple objects in quick succession.
You can only have one fountain active at once. If you try to place a second while the first is still going, it will instead stop the existing one.

### Barrel Mudball
Press shift (or your "Precise" key) while launching a mudball to launch a barrel instead.
